# LetterCounter1

The purpose of this code is to count all vowels used in the United States Constitution as well as the characters b, k, and z. The file beingn analyzed containing the Constitution is Constitution.txt. All letters and the counter are initialized to 0. From there, a while loop is used to advance from letter to letter. A nested switch structure is then used to determine what action needs to be taken as the program analyzes each character of the .txt file. If the character is a, b, e, i, k, o, u, or z, then 1 is added to the associated letter's integer variable. Once the end of the file is reached, then all the letter's occurences are summed up in totVariable. The number of occurrences of each letter are printed out as well as the total occurrences (totVariable). Constitution.txt is then closed out right before the program ends.
